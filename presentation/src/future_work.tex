    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beware of trying to use GPU Computing in any problem,
            remember the APOD design cycle.
        \item Using more than one HPC technique in an algorithm
            could be a really good idea (OpenMP, POSIX threads, etc).
        \item GraviDy is still on development and we are planning
            to add a lot of new features:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item KS-regularization.
            \item ...?
        \end{itemize}
        \item ...
    \end{itemize}
