    \begin{itemize}
        \item Beware of trying to use GPU Computing in any problem,
            (remember the \blue{APOD} design cycle).
        \item We are implementing more than one HPC technique.
            (OpenMP, POSIX threads, etc)
        \item GraviDy is still on development and we are planning
            to add new features, like:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item KS-regularization.
            \item Neighbour sphere treatment
            \item Geodetic implementation of EMRIs (see Patrick Brem's talk)
            \item Coupling with SPH stellar collisions
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
